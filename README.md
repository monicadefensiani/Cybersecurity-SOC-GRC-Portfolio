# Hello, I'm Monica Defensiani N  
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/monique-d-409874262/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I am a cybersecurity professional specialising in Security Operations (SOC) and Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC), focused on detecting and responding to threats while helping organisations align with industry frameworks such as ISO 27001, NIST CSF, and the ACSC Essential Eight.  
My goal is to combine hands-on SOC skills (detection, investigation, incident response) with strong governance and risk practices to reduce cyber risk in real-world environments.

## Completed - CyberNova Academy -100% Hands-On Cohort Training:(Cybersecurity SOC & GRC)
CyberNova Academy’s SOC & GRC Cohort is 100% hands-on, job-ready program designed to help learners build real SOC analyst capability (detection, triage, investigation, response) and GRC capability (risk, compliance, ISO 27001, Essential Eight alignment, audit readiness).  

Learners graduate with:
- A GitHub portfolio with practical SOC labs and write-ups.
- Evidence of detection engineering (KQL/SPL, dashboards, alerts, use cases).
- Incident response workflow experience (tickets, cases, playbooks, reports).
- GRC artifacts (risk register, policies, ISMS scope, audit evidence pack).
- Real-world tooling familiarity (SIEM (Splunk, Wazuh, Microsoft Sentinel), EDR/XDR ( Defender for Endpoint, SentinelOne, CrowdStrike), SOAR (Splunk Soar/Microsoft Sentinel Soar), threat intel, Vulnerability Management Tools (Tenable, Rapid 7 and Open VAS).

## About Monica Defensiani N, SOC & GRC Professional
As a SOC and GRC-focused cybersecurity professional, I work at the intersection of technical detection/response and governance-driven risk management.  
My interests include building SOC workflows, designing detections in SIEM platforms, and creating governance artifacts that map security controls to business risk and compliance requirements.

What I focus on:
- Hands-on SOC skills: log analysis, alert triage, threat hunting, and incident response in enterprise-style environments.
- GRC capability: risk assessments, control design, ISO 27001 and Essential Eight alignment, policy and audit preparation.
- Career development: building a strong portfolio on GitHub, documenting labs clearly, and continuously improving technical and governance skills.

## Objective
My objective is to build a career as a SOC and GRC professional, contributing to detection, response, and governance in modern enterprises.  
I am particularly interested in Tier 1/Tier 2 SOC analyst roles and junior GRC analyst roles where I can apply detection engineering, incident handling, and risk management to help organisations strengthen their security posture.

## SOC + GRC Cohort Outline 

### SOC Stream (Blue Team / Detection / Response)
- SOC Foundations: SOC roles (Tier 1/2/3), SLAs, escalation, ticket hygiene, shift handover.
- Networking for SOC: TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP(S), TLS, email, proxies, VPN, NAT.
- Windows & AD for SOC: logs, authentication, Kerberos, event IDs, common attack paths.
- Linux for SOC: auth logs, systemd, bash basics, cron, suspicious persistence.
- Log Management: telemetry sources, normalization, field mapping, enrichment.
- Detection Engineering: Sigma → SIEM rules, baseline vs anomaly, false positive tuning.
- Threat Hunting: hypothesis-based hunting, pivoting, timelines, investigation notes.
- Incident Response: triage → containment → eradication → recovery → lessons learned.
- SOAR Automation: playbooks, alert enrichment, auto-ticketing, auto-containment.
- Reporting: executive summaries, technical summaries, IOCs, MITRE ATT&CK mapping.

### GRC Stream (ISO 27001 / NIST / Essential Eight)
- GRC Foundations: governance vs risk vs compliance, three lines model, assurance.
- Risk Management: risk statements, likelihood/impact, inherent vs residual risk.
- ISO 27001 ISMS: scope, context, leadership, planning, support, operation, performance, improvement.
- Controls & Mapping: ISO 27001 Annex A mapping to NIST CSF, CIS Controls, Essential Eight.
- Policy & Procedures: acceptable use, access control, incident management, logging.
- Audit Prep: evidence collection, audit trails, control testing, nonconformities, CAPA.
- Third-Party Risk: vendor assessment, security questionnaires, contracts, due diligence.
- Governance Artifacts: risk register, SoA, ISMS scope, control implementation plan.
